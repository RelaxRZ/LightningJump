# Lightning Jump Detection & Severe Weather Forecast

### This project aims to develop an algorithm to track lightning all around Australia and detect lightning jumps happening in a specific area within a range of time. After the lightning jump algorithm is finished, the code for scanning the severe hail around that region is constructed and applied to validate the current model, designed for preparing future severe weather forecasts code development

### Code - Source Code of Visualisation, Lightning Jump Detection & Severe Hail Index Collection

#### 1. CZ_Code Folder
#### Chi Zhang Folder -- Data Cleaning, Preprocessing, Visualisation, Lightning Jump Detection & SHI Collection
##### Source code for cleaning the yearly lightning data in all around Australia recorded in CSV
##### Source code for obtaining the lightning cluster in a specific area within a range of time
##### Source code for tracking the lightning cluster movement track in a specific area along the time
##### Source code for detecting the lightning jump within each lightning cluster
##### Source code for collecting the severe hail index (SHI) information based on the detected lightning jump
##### Source code for plotting the visualisation of lightning cluster and radar image of severe hail
##### Folder for storing the generated preprocessed CSV file and visualsation

#### 2. GC_Code Folder
##### LSTM Potential -- Folder of LSTM Code that is constructed during the process of developing each Type of LSTM
##### Other Code -- Folder of Code that is used in Visualisation if Required
##### Deprecate Code -- Folder of Code that is Discared (Some csv can be Generated with these Code if Required)
