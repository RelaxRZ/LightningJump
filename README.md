# Lightning Jump Detection & Severe Weather Forecast

### This project aims to develop an algorithm to track lightning all around Australia and detect lightning jumps happening in a specific area within a range of time. After the lightning jump algorithm is finished, the code for scanning the severe hail around that region is constructed and applied to validate the current model, designed for preparing future severe weather forecasts code development
